The primary purpose of this blog is to serve as documentation and as a way to organize my thoughts as I work on whatever project interests me at the moment. The past few months I've been interested in static website generators and getting my blog up (which I've been procastinating on for almost an entire year since I registered my domain). The next few posts will cover what I've learned while working on this project.
