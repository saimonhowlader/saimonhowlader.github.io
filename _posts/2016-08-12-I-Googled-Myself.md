Because my name is relatively uncommon, search engines have very little trouble finding every single social networking account associated with my name. Until recently, the first few pages of search results were littered with links to my Facebook, Spotify and YouTube playlists, ASKfm questions (throwback!), obscure forums, non-sensible comments, posts, pictures and political opinions.

People with more common names and conventional spellings are typically hidden amongst others who share their name, buried deep within search results, and essentially invisble. However, for people with more ethnic names, and liberal spellings, the first page of Google search results can be a cringe inducing reminder of middle school.

Although I highly doubt anyone is googling my name I'd still like to control exactly what others can find out about me. In order to clean up my online prescence I first reserved saimonhowlader.com and then started combing through every single account that I could find linked to old usernames and old Gmail accounts. 

Aside from a couple active accounts, I deactivated everything else. I went through old accounts on Gmail, forums, music services, and even websites that were sending my old email acounts newsletters and coupons. I deleted every single accoint that I didn't use anymore. It took a few days, but afterwards every single link that used to point to an old profile started pointing to "404 user not found" errors. And after awhile even those links were removed by search engines for being duds.

After removing most of the references to my old profiles the next step was to repopulate the search results with more relevant links. The best way to make sure that your name appears at the top of Google search results is to create some social networking accounts, and a website with good SEO that is regularly updated with new content- such as a blog. And so, here we are.
