  The primary purpose of this blog is to serve as documentation and as a way to

About a year ago, I Googled myself... and since my name isn't very common, the first few pages were just filled with embarassing relics from when I was first legally allowed to check the Terms of Service box. There was all types of stupid shit, from dumb answers to dumb questions. If you happen to remember Formspring, I'm confident that you can imagine all the self-harm that can arise from middle school drama, especially public drama.

I went through old email accounts and combed through the first few pages and deleted every single non-essential account and profile I could find associated with my name or old usernames.  It took Google a while to finally get rid of all the search results that now pointed to "404 user not found" messages. For the most part, I erased myself from the internet, or rather just the first couple pages of Google search results. 

A few months ago I decided it would be best to now repopulate the search results with more relevant content. I was also meaning to start a blog, and so, here I am.
