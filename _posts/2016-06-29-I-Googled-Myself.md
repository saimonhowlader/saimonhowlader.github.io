Last summer I Googled myself and because my name has an uncommon spelling many of the results linked to my Facebook, Google+ and other social networks such as Spotify, Pandora, YouTube and even ASKfm. Considering that most of these accounts were created when I was in middle school one can easily imagine the shivers and cringes that resulted.

It can be quite scary to think about just how much embarassing information one can dig up on a person from a simple Google search. For some people with common names, and common spellings it's ussually fine, their identities are typically buried deep within search results, hidden amongst others who share their name. For people with more ethnic names, or uncommon spellings the entirety of the first page of Google search results can become one large Hall of Shame littered with snippets of embarassing comments, questions, statuses, and posts. Anyone familiar with formspring can only imagine the self destruction.

The only brightside to having an uncommon name is that it is easier to get oneself to the first few results. 

In order to clean up my online profile I first bought a domain for my name, I then started combing through every search result on the first few pages that linked back to my name and, aside from a couple active accounts, I deactivated them. I looked at just about every single account linked to my name from old Gmails, music services, forums, to even websites sending me email newsletters. It took a couple days but every single link that pointed to an old profile pointed to "404 user not found" messages. And after awhile even those links were removed by Google's search algorithm.

After removing most of the references to my old online profiles the next logical step was to repopulate the search results with more relevant references. The best way to make sure that one appears at the top of Google search results is to create content and have references going back to it. One of the easiest ways to do that is to have a website with the same domain as one's name and blog on it, and since I've been meaning to start a blog, here I am.
