Hi! I like to write about projects that keep me busy. Up till now I have been keeping track of my work and thought processes in a little book that I'd carry just about everywhere I took my bag/laptop, but a couple months ago I realized that carrying anything more than a laptop and my phone was becoming cumbersome. At some point I decided to finally get around to publishing a personal website for myself with my contact info. 


Some of my clients request that I write up documentation for them whenever I help them with some issue with their computers, websites or anything else in between. I figured it would be a good idea to keep a record of that kind of documentation on a website for both my clients as well myself as a sort of portfolio and reference manual. I was also becoming frustrated with the lack of documentation within the chromebook/dualbooting community so I figured I might as well keep a public record of that kind of work as well since I was already keeping records for myself.


Sometimes when I'm working on some code or some project I get confused about why I made a certain decision (such as why I chose one CSS preprossor over another, or why I decided to go with webhost "X" instead of "Y", or why I'm using an old linux kernel instead of the "obvious" more recent kernel). Often, this is simply because my commenting habits with abstrac projects aren't as diciplined as my commenting habits when coding. As a result this further supported my decision to keep a blog... oh and it's also supposed to be great as far as internet street cred goes. If this little project helps other people with their own work then that is obviously also a plus, but just to be clear blogging is not my livelihood or anything of that sort.
