Hi! I like to write about projects that keep me busy. The primary purpose of my blog posts is to serve as reference material when I get confused about a past project and to keep a record of my decision making process. My first project since my decision to start a blog was to get my own website hosted which involved exploring a variety of technologies such as WordPress, learning the basics of a few languages and some design theories. Although there are many well written guides to launching a website my first series of posts are going to be about my decision making process. The one after that may be about how to design a leather wallet from "scratch," or how to paint a wall, or how to dualboot on a chromebook, or even how to make beard oil at home.
